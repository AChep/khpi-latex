\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented the solution for the Clickbait Detector. We tackled the clickbait score prediction problem by performing classification using the LSTM network.

In our future efforts, we would like to focus more on specifically exploiting inconsistencies between the post text and the target text/title, instead of focusing only on the title. 
We should also focus more on the semantics of the language and not generic words.
