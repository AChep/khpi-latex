The object of the paper is the decision-making process of distribution logistic system.

The subject of the paper is the multiagent model of  distribution logistic system.

The goal of the research is to develop a multiagent system to study distribution logistic system.

To archive the goal, the main problems of modeling logistic systems were reviewed, described methods and algorithms of managing logistic systems.
Formed the requrements to the software.
Based on the requrements and comparing software platforms for developing multiagent systems were choosen program technologies for implementing the system. 

The software was developed and tested.

The system can be used by logistic companies to improve their service or by teachers and students to study the logistic systems.
