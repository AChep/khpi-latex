The object of the paper is the decision-making process of distribution logistic system.

The subject of the paper is the multiagent model of  distribution logistic system.

The goal of the research is to analyze the domain, describe models and algorithms of managing logistic systems.

To archive the goal, the main problems of modeling logistic systems were reviewed, described methods and algorithms of managing logistic systems.
