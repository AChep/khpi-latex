\subsection*{Writing, Job satisfaction}
Write an essay about job satisfaction:

\begin{answer}
The job is an inevitable part of life.
It's important that the job gives satisfaction, as it closely relates to our physical and mental state.
To find the perfect job, it is essential to know what one expects from the job. 

There are many factors related to job satisfaction, such as the salary and the need of being useful.
More wealth secures and improves the quality of life.
Secondly, the fulfillment of the need of being useful significantly determines the individual's mental stability that can evoke creative aspects in their performance.
Most importantly, the recreational facilities of the job, such as the promotions and the awards make the workers proud of what they do and keep their interest in their jobs high. 

However, to be realistic, the first thing worker should know is the fact that there's no <<ideal>> job.
It is wise to choose one that might be not perfect at this moment, but good enough and provides a career growth as perfect jobs are generally the top positions.

To summarize, seeking (and even imagining) good in current jobs will ensure job satisfaction.
\end{answer}
