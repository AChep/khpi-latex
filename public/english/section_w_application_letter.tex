Hello,\\[4pt]

I am writing to apply for the position of part-time Senior Android developer, as advertised.

I am a twenty-one-year-old student currently studying for Master's degree at Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute. I have over six year of experience in Android development.
In my previous position I worked with teams of 4-6 people and developed quite a few apps using Kotlin, Dark and Java programming languages.
I think the position at Google would be a great fit for me.

I would appreciate a lot if you let me know about your company's vacation and medical insurance policies and what month salary I can expect.

I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing back.
If you don't any current openings, feel free to hang on to my resume and contact me in the future.\\[4pt]

Regards,

Artem Chepurnoy
